\title{Frangi Vesselness Filter}
\usage{
frangi(image, mask, radius = 1, color = "dark", parallel = FALSE,
  cores = 2, c3d = F, min.scale = 0.5, max.scale = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{a 3D array or image of class \code{nifti}}

\item{mask}{an array or \code{nifti} mask of voxels for which vesselness will be calculated,
with more selective masking improving speed significantly.
Note that mask should be in the same space as the image volume}

\item{radius}{an integer specifying radius of the neighborhood (in voxels) for which the vesselness should be calculated.
Note that this value essentially serves as the scale of the vessel objects}

\item{color}{a string specifying whether vessels will appear darker ("dark") or brighter ("bright") than their surroundings}

\item{parallel}{is a logical value that indicates whether the user's computer
is Linux or Unix (i.e. macOS), and should run the code in parallel}

\item{cores}{if parallel = TRUE, cores is an integer value that indicates how many cores
the function should be run on}

\item{c3d}{a logical value reflecting whether or not the Convert3D imaging toolbox is installed.}

\item{min.scale}{if c3d==T, the minimum scale in mm of the structures being found.}

\item{max.scale}{if c3d==T, the maximum scale in mm of the structures being found.}
}
\value{
A 3D volume of the Frangi vesselness scores.
}
\description{
This function returns a vesselness map for a 3D array or NIfTI volume. This vesselness measure is based on the method described in Frangi et al., (1998).
